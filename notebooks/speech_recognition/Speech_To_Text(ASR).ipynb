        "\n",
        "1.  **Labeled Dataset:** You need a dataset where each audio sample has an accurate corresponding text transcription. We will continue using a subset of the `atlasia/DODa-audio-dataset` for this demonstration.\n",
        "2.  **Consistent Sampling Rate:** Wav2Vec2 models are pre-trained with audio at a specific sampling rate (commonly 16 kHz). All audio in your fine-tuning dataset *must* be resampled to match this rate. The `datasets` library can help with this.\n",
        "3.  **Vocabulary Definition:** The model needs a vocabulary, which is the set of all possible characters (or subwords) it can predict. This vocabulary is created from the transcriptions in your training dataset.\n",
        "4.  **Processor/Tokenizer:** A `Wav2Vec2Processor` (or `Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer` for older versions) handles both audio preprocessing (like resampling and normalization) and text tokenization (converting transcriptions into sequences of IDs based on the vocabulary).\n",

        "\n",
        "The fine-tuning process generally involves these steps:\n",

        "1.  **Set up the Environment:** Install necessary libraries like `transformers`, `datasets`, `evaluate`, and `accelerate` (for efficient training).\n",
        "2.  **Load Dataset and Processor:** Load your speech dataset and a pre-trained Wav2Vec2 processor (which includes a tokenizer).\n",
        "3.  **Preprocess Data:** Resample audio, tokenize transcriptions, and prepare the data in a format suitable for the model.\n",
        "4.  **Load Pre-trained Model:** Load a pre-trained Wav2Vec2 model suitable for ASR (e.g., `Wav2Vec2ForCTC`).\n",
        "5.  **Define Training Configuration:** Specify training arguments like learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and evaluation strategy.\n",
        "6.  **Define Evaluation Metrics:** Choose metrics to evaluate your model, typically Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER).\n",
        "7.  **Define Data Collator:** A data collator is responsible for batching your processed data samples and padding them so that all sequences in a batch have the same length.\n",
        "8.  **Instantiate and Run Trainer:** Use the Hugging Face `Trainer` class, which simplifies the training loop, handles evaluation, and saves checkpoints.\n",
