    "\n",
    "1. What are diffusion models?\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffusion models are generative models that learn to generate data by reversing a gradual noising process.\n",
    "They work by slowly adding random noise to data in a forward process, and then learning to reverse this\n",
    "process to recover the original data distribution. Unlike GANs or VAEs, diffusion models use a sequence\n",
    "of denoising steps, making them more stable to train but potentially slower to sample from.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Forward diffusion process:\n",
    "\n",
    "The forward diffusion process gradually adds Gaussian noise to an image over T timesteps according to a\n",
    "predefined noise schedule. At each step t, some portion of the original signal is preserved while new noise\n",
    "is added. As t increases, the image becomes more noisy until at t=T, it approaches a pure Gaussian noise\n",
    "distribution. Mathematically, this is defined as q(x_t|x_{t-1}) where each step adds a small amount of\n",
    "Gaussian noise according to variance β_t.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reverse diffusion process (sampling):\n",
    "\n",
    "The reverse diffusion process (sampling) starts with a pure noise sample x_T ~ N(0,1) and gradually denoises\n",
    "it over T steps to generate a sample from the data distribution. At each step, the model predicts the noise\n",
    "component in the current noisy image, then uses this prediction to compute a slightly less noisy image for\n",
    "the next step. This process continues until we reach x_0, which should resemble a sample from the original\n",

    "# ---------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the primary difference between GANs and Diffusion Models?\n",
    "\n",
    "SOLUTION: GANs use a generator and discriminator that are trained adversarially, where the generator tries to produce realistic samples to fool the discriminator. Diffusion models instead gradually add noise to data and then learn to reverse this process through denoising steps. GANs are often faster for sampling but can suffer from mode collapse and training instability, while diffusion models are more stable to train but typically require many steps for sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the forward diffusion process, what happens to the image as t increases?\n",
    "\n",
    "SOLUTION: As t increases during the forward diffusion process, the image becomes progressively noisier. The original content of the image gradually disappears and is replaced by random Gaussian noise. At t=T (the final step), the image is effectively pure noise with almost no trace of the original image information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What does the UNet model learn to predict in a DDPM?\n",
    "\n",
    "SOLUTION: The UNet model in a DDPM learns to predict the noise (ε) that was added to the image at a particular timestep. By learning to predict this noise component, the model can then remove it during the reverse diffusion process to gradually recover the clean image. This \"noise prediction\" approach has been shown to be more stable than directly predicting the clean image.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Why do we use a schedule for beta values rather than a constant value?\n",
    "\n",
    "SOLUTION: We use a schedule for beta values (typically linearly or quadratically increasing) to control the noise addition process more precisely. A gradual schedule allows the model to learn denoising at different noise levels - starting with small noise perturbations and gradually handling larger noise. This makes training more stable and allows the model to effectively learn the entire denoising process from almost-clean to very noisy images.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How does the sampling (reverse diffusion) process generate a new image?\n",
    "\n",
    "SOLUTION: The sampling process starts with pure Gaussian noise (x_T) and iteratively applies the trained denoising model to remove noise step by step. At each step t, the model predicts the noise component in the current noisy image, then uses this prediction to compute a slightly less noisy image for step t-1. The process continues for T steps until we reach x_0, which should be a clean image sample from the learned data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What's the significance of the parameter T (number of timesteps) in diffusion models?\n",
    "\n",
    "SOLUTION: The parameter T determines the number of diffusion steps in both the forward and reverse processes. A larger T means smaller noise additions at each step, making the diffusion process more gradual and potentially easier for the model to learn. However, larger T values also increase the computational cost and time required for sampling. There's a trade-off between quality (larger T) and sampling speed (smaller T).\n"
