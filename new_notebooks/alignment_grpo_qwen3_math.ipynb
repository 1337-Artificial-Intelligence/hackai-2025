    "# 🧠 Post-Training an LLM for Reasoning with GRPO in TRL\n",

    "[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/your-repo/hackai-challenges/blob/main/py/alignment_grpo_qwen3_math.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimated time needed: **90** minutes on a free T4 (Google Colab)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we guide you through the process of **post-training a Large Language Model (LLM)** using **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**, a method introduced in the [DeepSeekMath paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03300).\n",
    "\n",
    "GRPO is particularly effective for **scaling test-time compute for extended reasoning**, making it an ideal approach for tackling complex tasks such as mathematical problem-solving.\n",

    "#### 🧐 What is GRPO?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)** is a reinforcement learning (RL) post-training technique developed and used in the training of [DeepSeek-R1](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1). It builds on concepts from PPO and DPO, but introduces a **group-wise reward normalization**, enabling better reasoning and more stable learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike earlier techniques that relied heavily on search heuristics, GRPO **relies exclusively on RL** to fine-tune the LLM post-SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning), enhancing its capacity to solve nuanced, multi-step tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🔎 **Note**: Unlike DPO, GRPO does **not** use pairwise preference data. Instead, it relies on a **grouping of prompts by category or difficulty**, and optimizes based on **reward normalization within those groups**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GRPO method is available in the [TRL library](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/main/en/grpo_trainer#quick-start), and the Hugging Face Science team is actively working to reproduce the full DeepSeek-R1 training process via the [Open-R1 project](https://github.com/huggingface/open-r1).\n",

    "#### 💡 Why GRPO?\n",
    "\n",
    "GRPO was specifically designed to **enhance reasoning ability** by promoting group-aware learning. It:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encourages **relative improvement within groups of samples** (e.g., math questions of similar difficulty)\n",
    "- Promotes generalization across problem types\n",
    "- Improves robustness to reward outliers by normalizing over similar examples\n",
    "\n",
    "These advantages make GRPO especially promising for tasks that require **multi-step reasoning and consistency**, such as math, code generation, or logic-based problem-solving.\n",

    "In Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), reward functions are essential because they guide the preference-based optimization of the policy by comparing the quality of generated outputs within a group. Unlike standard Reinforcement Learning (RL), where absolute rewards are assigned to single actions or trajectories, GRPO relies on relative comparisons—often derived from human preferences or heuristics—to update the policy.\n",

The distance from $(0, y)$ to $A(-2, 0)$ is $\\sqrt{(-2 - 0)^2 + (0 - y)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + y^2}$. The distance from $(0, y)$ to $B(-1, 4)$ is $\\sqrt{(-1 - 0)^2 + (4 - y)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + (4 - y)^2}$. Setting these equal: $\\sqrt{4 + y^2} = \\sqrt{1 + (4 - y)^2}$. Squaring both sides: $4 + y^2 = 1 + (4 - y)^2$. Simplifying: $4 + y^2 = 1 + 16 - 8y + y^2$. Cancel $y^2$ and simplify: $4 = 17 - 8y$.

Let me start by understanding the problem.\\n\\nFirst, there\\'s an Asymptote figure provided, which I can\\'t see, but based on the code, it\\'s a graph with two functions: f(x) and g(x). The graph is drawn with some grid lines, and there are labels for y=p(x) and y=q(x). The question is about evaluating q(p(x)) at those x-values and summing the results.\\n\\nBut first, I need to figure out what p(x) and q(x) are. The Asymptote code defines f(x) as abs(x) - 2 and g(x) as -abs(x). Let me check that.\\n\\nSo f(x) = |x| - 2. That\\'s a V-shaped graph shifted down by 2 units. The vertex is at (0, -2). Then, g(x) = -|x|. That\\'s an upside-down V, with the vertex at (0, 0). So, the graph of g(x) is like a V opening downward.\\n\\nBut the problem mentions that the graph is drawn with operator .., which I think is for connecting points, so it\\'s a continuous graph. However, the labels are on the axes: y=p(x) and y=q(x). So, maybe p(x) is f(x) and q(x) is g(x)? But let me check.\\n\\nLooking at the Asymptote code: the graph is graph(f,-4,4,operator ..), blue+1.25; and graph(g,-4,4,operator ..), orange+1.25. Then, there are some lines drawn: (-3,-5)--(-1,-5), blue; and (-3,-6)--(-1,-6), orange. The labels are \"y=p(x)\" and \"y=q(x)\" at (-1,-5) and (-1,-6). \\n\\nSo, the blue line is y = p(x), which is f(x) = |x| - 2. But at x = -1, f(-1) = |-1| - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1. But the label is at (-1, -5). Wait, that seems like the point (-1, -5). But if the graph is from x=-4 to x=4, then maybe the blue line is not the entire graph? Wait, maybe the graph is drawn with operator .., which connects the points. But the coordinates given for the labels are (-1, -5) and (-1, -6). So, maybe the blue line is y = p(x) = |x| - 2, but when x = -1, that would be y = -1. But the label is at (-1, -5). That seems inconsistent. Wait, maybe the graph is not f(x) but something else?\\n\\nWait, maybe the functions are different. Let me check again. The Asymptote code defines f(x) as abs(x) - 2 and g(x) as -abs(x). Then, the graph of f(x) is drawn from -4 to 4 with operator .., which is a continuous curve. But the label for y=p(x) is at (-1, -5). If p(x) is f(x), then at x=-1, f(-1) = |-1| - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1. But the label is at (-1, -5). That\\'s a discrepancy. Maybe the label is for q(x)? Because the other line is y=q(x), which is -abs(x). At x=-1, that would be -1, but the label is at (-1, -6). Hmm.\\n\\nWait, maybe the functions are different. Let me think again. The problem says that the graph is drawn with operator .., which is for connecting points. Maybe the graph of f(x) is actually a piecewise function? Or maybe the graph is not the entire function?\\n\\nWait, maybe the graph of f(x) is drawn from -4 to 4, but with some points connected. Let me check the coordinates. If f(x) = |x| - 2, then at x = -4, f(-4) = 4 - 2 = 2. At x = -3, f(-3) = 3 - 2 = 1. At x = -2, f(-2) = 2 - 2 = 0. At x = -1, f(-1) = 1 - 2 = -1.

There's a cycle that connects points (0,0), (3, 3√3, 8), (3, -3√3, 8), (3, -3√3, 8), then back to (0,0). Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe the coordinates are in 3D?

Maybe there's a cube or something?\\n\\nBut then there's a lot of other lines. For example, there's a draw command that goes from (-6*cos(atan(-1/5)+3.14159), -6*sin(atan(-1/5)+3.14159), 0) to (6, 0, 0). Hmm. Let me try to compute those coordinates.\\n\\nFirst, atan(-1/5) is the angle whose tangent is -1/5. Since tan(θ) = -1/5, θ is in the fourth quadrant. Then adding π to that angle would be in the third quadrant. Let me compute cos(atan(-1/5) + π). Let me recall that tan(θ) = -1/5, so θ is in the fourth quadrant. Then θ + π is in the third quadrant. The cosine of θ + π is cos(π + θ) = -cos(θ). Similarly, sin(π + θ) = -sin(θ). So, cos(θ) = sqrt(1 - (1/5)^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/25) = sqrt(24/25) = 2*sqrt(6)/5. Wait, but θ is in the fourth quadrant, so cos(θ) is positive, and sin(θ) is negative. Therefore, cos(θ) = sqrt(1 - (1/5)^2) = sqrt(24)/5 = 2*sqrt(6)/5. Then sin(θ) = -1/5. Therefore, cos(θ + π) = -cos(θ) = -2*sqrt(6)/5, and sin(θ + π) = -sin(θ) = 1/5. Therefore, the point (-6*cos(atan(-1/5)+3.14159), -6*sin(atan(-1/5)+3.14159), 0) would be (-6*(-2*sqrt(6)/5), -6*(1/5), 0) = (12*sqrt(6)/5, -6/5, 0). Wait, but the coordinates are written as (-6*cos(...), -6*sin(...), 0). Wait, the original code is:\\n\\ndraw(rpic,(-6*cos(atan(-1/5)+3.14159),-6*sin(atan(-1/5)+3.14159),0)..(6,0,0));\\n\\nSo, the x-coordinate is -6*cos(...), y-coordinate is -6*sin(...), z-coordinate is 0. So, if θ is atan(-1/5), then θ + π is the angle, so cos(θ + π) is -cos(θ) = -2*sqrt(6)/5, and sin(θ + π) is 1/5. Therefore, the x-coordinate is -6*cos(θ + π) = -6*(-2*sqrt(6)/5) = 12*sqrt(6)/5, y-coordinate is -6*sin(θ + π) = -6*(1/5) = -6/5. Therefore, the point is (12\"}]\n",

A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The last two digits are 2 and 3, so their sum is 5. For the entire number to be divisible by 3, the sum of all digits must be a multiple of 3. The sum of the last two digits is 5, so the sum of the first two digits must be 2 (since 5 + 2 = 7, which is not divisible by 3, but 5 + 2 + 1 = 8, which is not divisible by 3). Wait, this approach is flawed. Let's correct it: the sum of the last two digits is 2 + 3 = 5. The entire number must have a digit sum divisible by 3. Let the first two digits be 'ab', where a and b are digits. Then the total digit sum is a + b + 5. This sum must be divisible by 3. So a + b + 5 ≡ 0 mod 3 ⇒ a + b ≡ 1 mod 3. Since a and b are digits (0-9), their sum must be 1 mod 3. The possible values for a + b are 1, 4, 7. Now, the first two digits 'ab' must be such that a + b = 1, 4, or 7. However, since the number is a four-digit number, the first digit 'a' cannot be 0. So, for a + b = 1: a can be 1, b = 0; a can be 2, b = -1 (invalid). So only (1, 0) is valid. For a + b = 4: a can be 1, b = 3; a can be 2, b = 2; a can be 3, b = 1; a can be 4, b = 0.

So total possibilities: 1 (for a + b = 1) + 3 (for a + b = 4) + 6 (for a + b = 7) = 10. But wait, the first digit a cannot be 0, so for a + b = 1: a=1, b=0 is valid.

Since d divides 2n - 5, it must also divide any integer combination of 2n - 5 and 9n - 2. Specifically, d divides 9(2n - 5) - (2n - 5) = 17n - 25.

This factorization allows us to rewrite the denominator as $(n - 1)^2(n + 1)^2 + 2^2$? Wait, let me correct that. The correct factorization is $n^4 + 4 = (n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)$. This is because $(n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2) = n^4 - 2n^3 + 2n^2 + 2n^3 - 4n^2 + 4n + 2n^2 - 4n + 4 = n^4 + 0n^3 + 0n^2 + 0n + 4 = n^4 + 4$. So the denominator factors as $(n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)$. Then, the sum becomes $\\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{n}{(n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)}$. We can use partial fractions. Let's set $\\\\frac{n}{(n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)} = \\\\frac{A}{n - 1} + \\\\frac{B}{n + 1} + \\\\frac{C}{n^2 + 2n + 2} + \\\\frac{D}{n^2 - 2n + 2}$. Solving for A, B, C, D would be tedious, but perhaps we can find a telescoping series. Alternatively, notice that the denominator can be written as $(n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2) = (n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)$. Let's consider the difference between terms. Let $a_n = \\\\frac{1}{n^2 + 2n + 2}$ and $b_n = \\\\frac{1}{n^2 - 2n + 2}$. Then, the sum becomes $\\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{n}{(n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)} = \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{n}{(n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)}$. Let's write the denominator as $(n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2) = (n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)$. Let's consider the difference between $\\\\frac{1}{n - 1}$ and $\\\\frac{1}{n + 1}$, but I need to think differently. Alternatively, since the denominator factors as $(n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)$, we can write the term as $\\\\frac{n}{(n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)} = \\\\frac{n}{(n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)}$. Let's consider the partial fractions. Let me try to find constants A and B such that $\\\\frac{n}{(n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)} = \\\\frac{A}{n - 1} + \\\\frac{B}{n + 1} + \\\\frac{C}{n^2 + 2n + 2} + \\\\frac{D}{n^2 - 2n + 2}$. Solving this would be complex, but perhaps we can use the fact that the sum telescopes. Alternatively, since the denominator is a product of quadratics, we can write the term as a difference of fractions. However, this might not be straightforward. Let\"}]\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer\n",
    "\n",
    "**This notebook demonstrates a simplified implementation of GRPO fine-tuning.** For production-level applications, this approach should be significantly expanded and refined. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The training duration (50 steps) is far too short for meaningful learning\n",
    "2. The reward functions are basic implementations that would benefit from more sophisticated alternatives\n",
    "3. Proper group construction requires careful analysis of your specific dataset\n",
    "4. Larger models (7B+ parameters) typically yield better reasoning capabilities\n",
    "5. More extensive evaluation on diverse test sets is essential for real-world deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "For research or production applications, we recommend:\n",
    "- Increasing training steps by at least 100x\n",
    "- Using more sophisticated reward modeling techniques\n",
    "- Implementing proper group balancing and sampling strategies\n",
    "- Considering multi-stage training approaches (SFT → GRPO)\n",
    "- Developing robust evaluation suites for mathematical reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplicity of this notebook is designed for educational purposes and to fit within Colab's resource constraints."

Let me start by understanding the problem.\\n\\nFirst, there\\'s an Asymptote figure provided, which I can\\'t see, but based on the code, it\\'s a graph with two functions: f(x) and g(x). The graph is drawn with some grid lines, and there are labels for y=p(x) and y=q(x). The question is about evaluating q(p(x)) at those x-values and summing the results.\\n\\nBut first, I need to figure out what p(x) and q(x) are. The Asymptote code defines f(x) as abs(x) - 2 and g(x) as -abs(x). Let me check that.\\n\\nSo f(x) = |x| - 2. That\\'s a V-shaped graph shifted down by 2 units. The vertex is at (0, -2). Then, g(x) = -|x|. That\\'s an upside-down V, with the vertex at (0, 0). So, the graph of g(x) is like a V opening downward.\\n\\nBut the problem mentions that the graph is drawn with operator .., which I think is for connecting points, so it\\'s a continuous graph. However, the labels are on the axes: y=p(x) and y=q(x). So, maybe p(x) is f(x) and q(x) is g(x)? But let me check.\\n\\nLooking at the Asymptote code: the graph is graph(f,-4,4,operator ..), blue+1.25; and graph(g,-4,4,operator ..), orange+1.25. Then, there are some lines drawn: (-3,-5)--(-1,-5), blue; and (-3,-6)--(-1,-6), orange. The labels are \"y=p(x)\" and \"y=q(x)\" at (-1,-5) and (-1,-6). \\n\\nSo, the blue line is y = p(x), which is f(x) = |x| - 2. But at x = -1, f(-1) = |-1| - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1. But the label is at (-1, -5). Wait, that seems like the point (-1, -5). But if the graph is from x=-4 to x=4, then maybe the blue line is not the entire graph? Wait, maybe the graph is drawn with operator .., which connects the points. But the coordinates given for the labels are (-1, -5) and (-1, -6). So, maybe the blue line is y = p(x) = |x| - 2, but when x = -1, that would be y = -1. But the label is at (-1, -5). That seems inconsistent. Wait, maybe the graph is not f(x) but something else?\\n\\nWait, maybe the functions are different. Let me check again. The Asymptote code defines f(x) as abs(x) - 2 and g(x) as -abs(x). Then, the graph of f(x) is drawn from -4 to 4 with operator .., which is a continuous curve. But the label for y=p(x) is at (-1, -5). If p(x) is f(x), then at x=-1, f(-1) = |-1| - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1. But the label is at (-1, -5). That\\'s a discrepancy. Maybe the label is for q(x)? Because the other line is y=q(x), which is -abs(x). At x=-1, that would be -1, but the label is at (-1, -6). Hmm.\\n\\nWait, maybe the functions are different. Let me think again. The problem says that the graph is drawn with operator .., which is for connecting points. Maybe the graph of f(x) is actually a piecewise function? Or maybe the graph is not the entire function?\\n\\nWait, maybe the graph of f(x) is drawn from -4 to 4, but with some points connected. Let me check the coordinates. If f(x) = |x| - 2, then at x = -4, f(-4) = 4 - 2 = 2. At x = -3, f(-3) = 3 - 2 = 1. At x = -2, f(-2) = 2 - 2 = 0. At x = -1, f(-1) = 1 - 2 = -1.

Let me try to compute those coordinates.\\n\\nFirst, atan(-1/5) is the angle whose tangent is -1/5. Since tan(θ) = -1/5, θ is in the fourth quadrant. Then adding π to that angle would be in the third quadrant. Let me compute cos(atan(-1/5) + π). Let me recall that tan(θ) = -1/5, so θ is in the fourth quadrant. Then θ + π is in the third quadrant. The cosine of θ + π is cos(π + θ) = -cos(θ). Similarly, sin(π + θ) = -sin(θ). So, cos(θ) = sqrt(1 - (1/5)^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/25) = sqrt(24/25) = 2*sqrt(6)/5. Wait, but θ is in the fourth quadrant, so cos(θ) is positive, and sin(θ) is negative. Therefore, cos(θ) = sqrt(1 - (1/5)^2) = sqrt(24)/5 = 2*sqrt(6)/5. Then sin(θ) = -1/5. Therefore, cos(θ + π) = -cos(θ) = -2*sqrt(6)/5, and sin(θ + π) = -sin(θ) = 1/5. Therefore, the point (-6*cos(atan(-1/5)+3.14159), -6*sin(atan(-1/5)+3.14159), 0) would be (-6*(-2*sqrt(6)/5), -6*(1/5), 0) = (12*sqrt(6)/5, -6/5, 0). Wait, but the coordinates are written as (-6*cos(...), -6*sin(...), 0). Wait, the original code is:\\n\\ndraw(rpic,(-6*cos(atan(-1/5)+3.14159),-6*sin(atan(-1/5)+3.14159),0)..(6,0,0));\\n\\nSo, the x-coordinate is -6*cos(...), y-coordinate is -6*sin(...), z-coordinate is 0. So, if θ is atan(-1/5), then θ + π is the angle, so cos(θ + π) is -cos(θ) = -2*sqrt(6)/5, and sin(θ + π) is 1/5. Therefore, the x-coordinate is -6*cos(θ + π) = -6*(-2*sqrt(6)/5) = 12*sqrt(6)/5, y-coordinate is -6*sin(θ + π) = -6*(1/5) = -6/5. Therefore, the point is (12\"}]\n",

Let the first two digits be 'ab', where a and b are digits. Then the total digit sum is a + b + 5. This sum must be divisible by 3. So a + b + 5 ≡ 0 mod 3 ⇒ a + b ≡ 1 mod 3. Since a and b are digits (0-9), their sum must be 1 mod 3. The possible values for a + b are 1, 4, 7. Now, the first two digits 'ab' must be such that a + b = 1, 4, or 7. However, since the number is a four-digit number, the first digit 'a' cannot be 0. So, for a + b = 1: a can be 1, b = 0; a can be 2, b = -1 (invalid). So only (1, 0) is valid. For a + b = 4: a can be 1, b = 3; a can be 2, b = 2; a can be 3, b = 1; a can be 4, b = 0. For a + b = 7: a can be 1, b = 6; a can be 2, b = 5; a can be 3, b = 4; a can be 4, b = 3; a can be 5, b = 2; a can be 6, b = 1; a can be 7, b = 0. So total possibilities: 1 (for a + b = 1) + 3 (for a + b = 4) + 6 (for a + b = 7) = 10. But wait, the first digit a cannot be 0, so for a + b = 1: a=1, b=0 is valid. For a + b = 4: a=1, b=3; a=2, b=2; a=3, b=1; a=4, b=0. All valid. For a + b = 7: a=1, b=6; a=2, b=5; a=3, b=4; a=4, b=3; a=5, b=2; a=6, b=1; a=7, b=0. All valid. So total of 1 + 3 + 6 = 10 possibilities. But the answer is 10. Wait, but the original reasoning was flawed. Let me recount. The correct count is 10. But the answer might be 10.

Since d divides 2n - 5, it must also divide any integer combination of 2n - 5 and 9n - 2. Specifically, d divides 9(2n - 5) - (2n - 5) = 17n - 25. Similarly, d divides 2(2n - 5) - (9n - 2) = 4n - 10 - 9n + 2 = -5n - 8. Continuing this process, we can find that d must divide 5n + 8 and 2n - 5. The greatest common divisor of 2n - 5 and 5n + 8 must be 1 or greater. If d > 1, then it must divide their difference, which is 3n + 3. Thus, d divides 3n + 3 and 2n - 5.

Let's denote the faces as follows: let the faces be labeled such that the front face is $a$, the back face is $b$, the left face is $c$, the right face is $d$, the top face is $e$, and the bottom face is $f$. \\n\\nThe vertices are:\\n- Front-top-left: $a \\\\cdot e \\\\cdot c$\\n- Front-top-right: $a \\\\cdot e \\\\cdot d$\\n- Front-bottom-left: $a \\\\cdot f \\\\cdot c$\\n- Front-bottom-right: $a \\\\cdot f \\\\cdot d$\\n- Back-top-left: $b \\\\cdot e \\\\cdot c$\\n- Back-top-right: $b \\\\cdot e \\\\cdot d$\\n- Back-bottom-left: $b \\\\cdot f \\\\cdot c$\\n- Back-bottom-right: $b \\\\cdot f \\\\cdot d$\\n\\nThe sum of the vertex values is $1001$, so:\\n$$\\n(a \\\\cdot e \\\\cdot c) + (a \\\\cdot e \\\\cdot d) + (a \\\\cdot f \\\\cdot c) + (a \\\\cdot f \\\\cdot d) + (b \\\\cdot e \\\\cdot c) + (b \\\\cdot e \\\\cdot d) + (b \\\\cdot f \\\\cdot c) + (b \\\\cdot f \\\\cdot d) = 1001\\n$$\\n\\nFactor out common terms:\\n$$\\na \\\\cdot e \\\\cdot c + a \\\\cdot e \\\\cdot d + a \\\\cdot f \\\\cdot c + a \\\\cdot f \\\\cdot d + b \\\\cdot e \\\\cdot c + b \\\\cdot e \\\\cdot d + b \\\\cdot f \\\\cdot c + b \\\\cdot f \\\\cdot d\\n$$\\n\\nGroup terms:\\n$$\\na \\\\cdot e \\\\cdot (c + d) + a \\\\cdot f \\\\cdot (c + d) + b \\\\cdot e \\\\cdot (c + d) + b \\\\cdot f \\\\cdot (c + d)\\n$$\\n\\nFactor out $ (c + d) $:\\n$$\\n(c + d)(a \\\\cdot e + a \\\\cdot f + b \\\\cdot e + b \\\\cdot f)\\n$$\\n\\nFactor further:\\n$$\\n(c + d)(a(e + f) + b(e + f)) = (c + d)(e + f)(a + b)\\n$$\\n\\nSo the sum of the vertex values is $ (c + d)(e + f)(a + b) = 1001 $.\\n\\nNow, since $1001 = 7 \\\\times 11 \\\\times 13$, the possible factorizations of 1001 into three integers are $1 \\\\times 1 \\\\times 1001$, $1 \\\\times 7 \\\\times 143$, $1 \\\\times 11 \\\\times 91$, $1 \\\\times 77 \\\\times 13$, $7 \\\\times 11 \\\\times 13$, and others. Since $a, b, c, d, e, f$ are positive integers, $c + d$ and $e + f$ must be positive integers greater than or equal to 1. Also, $a + b$ must be a positive integer.\\n\\nLet’s consider the factorization $7 \\\\times 11 \\\\times 13$. Then $ (c + d)(e + f)(a + b) = 1001 $, so $ (c + d)(e + f) = 7 \\\\times 11 \\\\times 13 $ divided by $a + b$. Let’s try $a + b = 7$, then $ (c + d)(e + f) = 11 \\\\times 13 = 143 $. Then $c + d$ and $e + f$ are positive integers such that their product is 143. Possible pairs are (1, 143), (11, 13), (7, 20.428...), but since $c$ and $d$ are positive integers, $c + d$ must be an integer. So possible pairs are (1, 143), (11, 13). Let's try $c + d = 11$ and $e + f = 13$. Then $a + b = 7$. Let’s assign values such that $a + b = 7$. Let’s say $a = 1$, $b = 6$. Then $c + d = 11$ and $e +\"}]\n",

However, the problem states that two large triangles are distinguishable if they cannot be transformed into each other via translations, rotations, and reflections. Since the large triangle is made by placing four small triangles, the key is to determine how many distinct colorings of the small triangles result in distinct large triangles under the given symmetry operations. However, the Asymptote code draws a large triangle made of four small triangles, but the exact configuration is not clear. Given the problem's complexity and the need for a concise answer, the most straightforward approach is to consider that each small triangle can be colored in 6 ways, but since the large triangle is constructed from four small ones, and the problem states that the large triangle is distinguishable based on colorings, the answer is 6. However, considering the possible symmetries and the need for distinct large triangles, the answer might be 6.

This results in a sequence where each term is slightly larger than 1, and the difference between consecutive terms becomes smaller. However, since the sequence is defined recursively and each term is greater than 1, the product a_0 a_1 a_2 ... will approach a finite limit. But since the terms are all greater than 1 and the sequence is increasing, the product may not converge to a finite value. However, the problem asks to compute the product up to the infinite sequence, which suggests that the product might converge to a specific value.

Let's place the quadrilateral in the coordinate plane. Let D be at the origin (0, 0). Since angle D is 60 degrees and DA = 24, point A can be at (24, 0). Then, since angle D is 60 degrees, point C can be found by rotating point A around D by 60 degrees. The coordinates of C are (24*cos(60°), 24*sin(60°)) = (12, 12√3). Now, since BC = 13 and AB = 13, we can find the coordinates of B. Let's denote B as (x, y). The distance from B to C is 13, so (x - 12)^2 + (y - 12√3)^2 = 13^2 = 169. The distance from B to A is 13, so (x - 24)^2 + y^2 = 169. Solving these equations will give the coordinates of B.

These points lie on the circle with center (7,13) and radius 13. The circle intersects the horizontal lines y=12 and y=14 at two points each.

    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer\n",
    "\n",
    "**This notebook demonstrates a simplified implementation of GRPO fine-tuning.** For production-level applications, this approach should be significantly expanded and refined. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The training duration (50 steps) is far too short for meaningful learning\n",
    "2. The reward functions are basic implementations that would benefit from more sophisticated alternatives\n",
    "3. Proper group construction requires careful analysis of your specific dataset\n",
    "4. Larger models (7B+ parameters) typically yield better reasoning capabilities\n",
    "5. More extensive evaluation on diverse test sets is essential for real-world deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "For research or production applications, we recommend:\n",
    "- Increasing training steps by at least 100x\n",
    "- Using more sophisticated reward modeling techniques\n",
    "- Implementing proper group balancing and sampling strategies\n",
    "- Considering multi-stage training approaches (SFT → GRPO)\n",
    "- Developing robust evaluation suites for mathematical reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplicity of this notebook is designed for educational purposes and to fit within Colab's resource constraints."
