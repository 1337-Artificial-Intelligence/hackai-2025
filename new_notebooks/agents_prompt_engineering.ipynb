    "# Prompt Engineering for Beginners üöÄ\n",
    "\n",
    "> In this notebook, you'll learn how to effectively communicate with AI models through prompts. Think of prompts as instructions you give to AI - the better your instructions, the better the results!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Prompt Engineering? ü§î\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering is the art of writing clear instructions (prompts) that help AI models understand exactly what you want them to do. It's like giving directions to a friend - the clearer your directions, the easier it is for them to help you!\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "A simple prompt without instructions - the AI just tries to complete the sentence\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "A better prompt with clear instructions and data\n",
    "\n",

    "    \n",
    "An even better prompt that specifies exactly what we want in the output\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Building Blocks of a Good Prompt üèóÔ∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "A good prompt usually includes these key parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Role**: Tell the AI what role to play (e.g., \"You are a friendly math tutor\")\n",
    "* **Task**: What exactly do you want the AI to do?\n",
    "* **Context**: Any important background information\n",
    "* **Format**: How should the AI structure its response?\n",
    "* **Examples**: Show the AI what you want (optional but helpful!)\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "![image](https://i.postimg.cc/C5cKWYTQ/pe6.png)\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Different Ways to Give Examples üìù\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main ways to show the AI what you want:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Zero-shot**: No examples, just instructions\n",
    "* **One-shot**: One example to show what you want\n",
    "* **Few-shot**: Multiple examples to make it crystal clear\n",

    "## Understanding AI Chat Roles üë•\n",
    "\n",
    "When chatting with AI, there are three main roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **System**: Sets up the AI's personality and rules\n",
    "* **User**: That's you! Your questions and instructions\n",
    "* **Assistant**: The AI's responses\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://i.postimg.cc/vHmT515F/pe8.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    \"role\": \"system\",\n",
    "    \"content\": \"You are a friendly math tutor who explains things simply.\"\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    \"role\": \"user\",\n",
    "    \"content\": \"What is 2+2?\"\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n",
    "    \"content\": \"2+2 equals 4! Think of it like having 2 apples and getting 2 more - now you have 4 apples!\"\n",
