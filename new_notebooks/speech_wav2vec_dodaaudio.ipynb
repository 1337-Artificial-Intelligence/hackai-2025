    "## 2.4 Visualizing Speech: Waveforms and Spectrograms\n",
    "\n",
    "Listening to audio is intuitive, but visualizing it can reveal patterns and characteristics that are not immediately obvious to the ear. Two common ways to visualize audio are waveforms and spectrograms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Waveforms:** A waveform is a graphical representation of an audio signal that shows the changes in air pressure over time. It's the most direct visual representation of the raw audio data. From a waveform, you can get a sense of the loudness and a rough idea of the speech segments versus silence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spectrograms:** A spectrogram is a more informative visualization. It shows the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. In a typical spectrogram, the horizontal axis represents time, the vertical axis represents frequency, and the intensity or color of each point represents the Amplitude/Energy of that particular frequency at that particular time. Spectrograms are incredibly useful in speech recognition because they highlight the phonetic(characters sounds) content of speech, making different sounds visually distinct. They essentially show *what* frequencies are present *when* and *how strongly*.\n",

    "## 3.1 Preparing for Fine-tuning: Data is Key\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the code, let's discuss data preparation for fine-tuning Wav2Vec2:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Labeled Dataset:** You need a dataset where each audio sample has an accurate corresponding text transcription. We will continue using a subset of the `atlasia/DODa-audio-dataset` for this demonstration.\n",
    "2.  **Consistent Sampling Rate:** Wav2Vec2 models are pre-trained with audio at a specific sampling rate (commonly 16 kHz). All audio in your fine-tuning dataset *must* be resampled to match this rate. The `datasets` library can help with this.\n",
    "3.  **Vocabulary Definition:** The model needs a vocabulary, which is the set of all possible characters (or subwords) it can predict. This vocabulary is created from the transcriptions in your training dataset.\n",
    "4.  **Processor/Tokenizer:** A `Wav2Vec2Processor` (or `Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer` for older versions) handles both audio preprocessing (like resampling and normalization) and text tokenization (converting transcriptions into sequences of IDs based on the vocabulary).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.2 The Fine-tuning Process: An Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The fine-tuning process generally involves these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Set up the Environment:** Install necessary libraries like `transformers`, `datasets`, `evaluate`, and `accelerate` (for efficient training).\n",
    "2.  **Load Dataset and Processor:** Load your speech dataset and a pre-trained Wav2Vec2 processor (which includes a tokenizer).\n",
    "3.  **Preprocess Data:** Resample audio, tokenize transcriptions, and prepare the data in a format suitable for the model.\n",
    "4.  **Load Pre-trained Model:** Load a pre-trained Wav2Vec2 model suitable for ASR (e.g., `Wav2Vec2ForCTC`).\n",
    "5.  **Define Training Configuration:** Specify training arguments like learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and evaluation strategy.\n",
    "6.  **Define Evaluation Metrics:** Choose metrics to evaluate your model, typically Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER).\n",
    "7.  **Define Data Collator:** A data collator is responsible for batching your processed data samples and padding them so that all sequences in a batch have the same length.\n",
    "8.  **Instantiate and Run Trainer:** Use the Hugging Face `Trainer` class, which simplifies the training loop, handles evaluation, and saves checkpoints.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `feature_size`: Speech models take a sequence of feature vectors as an input. While the length of this sequence obviously varies, the feature size should not. In the case of Wav2Vec2, the feature size is 1 because the model was trained on the raw speech signal ${}^2$.\n",
    "- `sampling_rate`: The sampling rate at which the model is trained on.\n",
    "- `padding_value`: For batched inference, shorter inputs need to be padded with a specific value\n",
    "- `do_normalize`: Whether the input should be *zero-mean-unit-variance* normalized or not. Usually, speech models perform better when normalizing the input\n",
    "- `return_attention_mask`: Whether the model should make use of an `attention_mask` for batched inference. In general, models should **always** make use of the `attention_mask` to mask padded tokens. However, due to a very specific design choice of `Wav2Vec2`'s \"base\" checkpoint, better results are achieved when using no `attention_mask`. This is **not** recommended for other speech models. For more information, one can take a look at [this](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/issues/3227) issue. **Important** If you want to use this notebook to fine-tune [large-lv60](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large-lv60), this parameter should be set to `True`."
